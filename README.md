# MercuriX (WIP)

## Overview

This is one Mercury Zero G very modified to independent dual extrusion

Original project:
https://docs.zerog.one/
Source of inspiration and some stuff:
https://github.com/joseph-greiner/Tridex

The primary purpose of this IDEX printer is to enable dual material prints for soluble/removable supports (ABS + HIPS, PETG + PLA, etc) and dual color within the same material. 
Other methods of printing dual materials within a single toolhead (MMU, Palette, etc) have issues due to mixing/contamination within the nozzle which may cause poor layer adhesion. These methods require huge filament purges/blocks, that can be avoided or minimized with an IDEX design.

# This is an advanced DIY 3d printer build. This should not be your first DIY 3d printer, or your first Klipper 3d printer. There is a substantial amount of firmware configuration, macros, slicer setup, tuning, and calibration needed to get from a physically built printer to reliable multi material printer.

## Specifications

- New frame able to be enclosed
- Build upon the Hydra 250mm or 275mm size bed (only need two new printed parts)
  https://docs.zerog.one/manual/build/hydra
- e34m1 toolhead with custom parts to the idex system. The mounts for extruders, hotends and probes, all should be still compatible (please report if not)

## Firmware

For the klipper part please check the awesome work from Joseph:
https://github.com/joseph-greiner/tridex_mods/tree/main/printer_configuration
This will be needed to adjust to this build! (endstops, size, etc etc)

And for the slicer:

To adjust XY Offsets this is very useful:
